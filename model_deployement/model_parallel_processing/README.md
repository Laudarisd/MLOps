# Model Parallel Inference

In real-world scenarios, deploying multiple AI/ML models in parallel is common for handling complex tasks efficiently. In production environments, several approaches and techniques ensure effective model inference. Below are some important considerations and strategies for model parallel inference, focusing on both multiprocessing and distributed inference.

## 1. Pipeline Inference

**Definition**: Pipeline inference organizes models in a sequence where the output of one model is the input for the next. This is useful when models contribute to different parts of a task.

**Example Use Case**: A model for image pre-processing followed by a model for object detection, and finally a model for classification.

**Advantages**:
- Simplifies model management by breaking down a complex task into smaller, specialized models.

**Challenges**:
- Latency can be an issue since models must wait for previous stages to complete.

---

## 2. Parallel Ensemble Models

**Definition**: Multiple models are run in parallel and their outputs are combined (e.g., averaging, voting) to produce a final prediction.

**Example Use Case**: Bagging or boosting techniques where multiple weak learners work together.

**Advantages**:
- Improves model accuracy and robustness.

**Challenges**:
- Increased resource consumption due to the simultaneous execution of multiple models.

---

## 3. Model Sharding

**Definition**: Splitting a large model into smaller components (shards) to run across multiple devices, useful for large models that cannot fit into a single machine's memory.

**Example Use Case**: Deploying large language models such as GPT-3 across multiple GPUs for inference.

**Advantages**:
- Allows large models to scale across different resources.

**Challenges**:
- Communication overhead between shards must be managed efficiently.

---

## 4. Data Parallelism

**Definition**: Running multiple instances of the same model on different data subsets in parallel, especially useful for batch processing and large datasets.

**Example Use Case**: Running inference on different data batches across multiple GPUs.

**Advantages**:
- Improves throughput by distributing the workload across multiple devices.

**Challenges**:
- Data synchronization and model consistency across devices need to be managed.

## Python Example 1: Using `ProcessPoolExecutor` for Parallel Inference

`ProcessPoolExecutor` is suitable for CPU-bound tasks like model inference in production, as it spawns separate processes that run on multiple CPU cores. Below is an example of how to use it for model parallel inference.

```python
import concurrent.futures
import time

# Simulate Model Inference
def model_1(data):
    print("Model 1 is processing...")
    time.sleep(2)  # Simulate processing time
    return f"Model 1 result on {data}"

def model_2(data):
    print("Model 2 is processing...")
    time.sleep(3)  # Simulate processing time
    return f"Model 2 result on {data}"
```

# Model Parallel Inference with ProcessPoolExecutor
def parallel_inference(data):
    with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
        future_1 = executor.submit(model_1, data)
        future_2 = executor.submit(model_2, data)

        result_1 = future_1.result()
        result_2 = future_2.result()

    return result_1, result_2

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    data = "input_data"
    results = parallel_inference(data)
    print(f"Results: {results}")

Pool Executor but in high level of production we can choose another options which is explain below:



# Parallel Processing Options for Production Inference

When deploying AI/ML models in production, we need to consider multiple factors like scalability, fault tolerance, and performance. While `ProcessPoolExecutor` is a good option for CPU-bound tasks, there are more advanced solutions tailored for production-grade deployments, especially when handling GPU-based tasks or when scaling across multiple servers.

This guide outlines several parallel processing techniques and tools that are best suited for production environments.

## 1. Celery with Redis or RabbitMQ

**Celery** is an asynchronous task queue that can be used for distributed processing. It's particularly useful for environments where we need to distribute model inference tasks across multiple workers or machines. We can use **Redis** or **RabbitMQ** as a message broker to manage tasks.

- **Best for**: Distributed inference, asynchronous processing, large-scale deployments.
- **Advantages**:
  - Scalable to multiple workers.
  - Fault tolerance (tasks can retry if a worker fails).
  - Handles real-time and batch processing.
- **Drawbacks**:
  - Requires setting up and managing message brokers like Redis or RabbitMQ.
  - Slightly more complex than `ProcessPoolExecutor`.


### Example using Celery:

```python
from celery import Celery
import time

app = Celery('tasks', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0')

@app.task
def model_1(data):
    print("Model 1 is processing...")
    time.sleep(2)
    return f"Model 1 result: {data}"

@app.task
def model_2(data):
    print("Model 2 is processing...")
    time.sleep(3)
    return f"Model 2 result: {data}"
```


### FastAPI Integration:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from tasks import model_1, model_2

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/inference/")
async def inference(data: str):
    result_1 = model_1.apply_async((data,))
    result_2 = model_2.apply_async((data,))
    return {
        "model_1_result": result_1.get(),
        "model_2_result": result_2.get()
    }

```

## Kubernetes with Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)

Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration platform that is highly suitable for managing production workloads. We can deploy our models as Docker containers and use Kubernetesâ€™ Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to dynamically scale the number of pods based on traffic, CPU usage, memory usage, or custom metrics.

- **Best for**: scale, distributed systems running in the cloud or on multiple servers.
- **Advantages**:
    - High scalability and fault tolerance.
    - Automatic scaling with Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA).
    - Rolling updates and deployments are easy to manage.
- **Drawbacks**:
    - Requires setting up and managing Kubernetes infrastructure.
    - More complex than process or thread pools for simple use cases.

### Example Kubernetes Architecture:

1. Create Docker Containers for each AI/ML model.
2. Deploy Containers to Kubernetes Pods.
3. Set up Autoscaling: Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to automatically scale up or down based on traffic or resource usage.

### Pod Autoscaling YAML Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v1
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: model-inference
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: model-inference-deployment
  minReplicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 10
  targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 80
```


## Ray for Distributed Machine Learning
Ray is a distributed framework designed for scaling Python applications, especially for machine learning tasks. It can parallelize model inference across multiple nodes in a cluster, making it suitable for large-scale production environments.

- **Best for**: Distributed machine learning workflows, scaling inference across clusters of machines.
- **Advantages**:
    - Simple API for parallel processing.
    - Highly scalable across multiple nodes.
    - Native integration with machine learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- **Drawbacks**:
    - Requires configuring a Ray cluster.
    - Some overhead in setting up distributed resources.

### Example Using Ray for Model Parallelism:

```python
import ray
import time

ray.init()

@ray.remote
def model_1(data):
    print("Model 1 is processing...")
    time.sleep(2)
    return f"Model 1 result on {data}"

@ray.remote
def model_2(data):
    print("Model 2 is processing...")
    time.sleep(3)
    return f"Model 2 result on {data}"

# Submit tasks in parallel
future_1 = model_1.remote("input_data")
future_2 = model_2.remote("input_data")

# Collect results
results = ray.get([future_1, future_2])
print(f"Results: {results}")

```

    -v /path_to_model:/models/my_model \
    -e MODEL_NAME=my_model -t tensorflow/serving
```
